## Introduction

Static Access allows only entries written by identities included in an immutable list to be added to the replica.

## Manifest Configuration

If a manifest includes the protocol key: `'/hldb/access/static/1.0.0'` this access protocol is to be used.

The config field must contain a non-empty array of either `'*'`, which is a wildcard, or identities' public keys used for access control.

### Format

```
{
  protocol: '/hldb/access/static/1.0.0',
  config: { writers: type 4<'*' | type 2> }
}
```

## Access Logic

Only entries created by an identity whose public key used for access control are included in config.writers pass access; unless config.writers includes a `'*'`, wildcard.
