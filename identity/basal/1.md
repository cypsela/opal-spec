## Introduction

The Basal Identity is used for validation and access control of database entries.
Version 1 is made up of two secp256k1 public keys and an ECDSA signature.

The first public key is used to validate the entry signature. 

The second public key is used for replica access control.

The ECDSA signature shows ownership of the second public key by the first public key.

## Format

A Basal Identity is a data structure, encoded using dag-cbor [[spec](https://github.com/ipld/ipld/blob/master/specs/codecs/dag-cbor/spec.md)] and containing the following fields:

- **device** (bytes)
  - The identity signing key.
  - It must be a compressed* secp256k1 public key.
  - Used to sign database entries.
  - May be the same key used in the `account` field.

- **account** (bytes)
  - The identity owner key.
  - It must be a compressed* secp256k1 public key.
  - Used for access control.
  - Public key of private key used to sign key in `device` field.

- **sig** (bytes)
  - The signature of `account` field public key signing `device` field public key bytes.
  - It must be an ECDSA signature.
  - Verifies that the `device` field public key belongs to the `account` field public key.

    device: type 2
    account: type 2
    sig: type 2
  }
```

## Validatity Constraints

- The identity passes the [ipld schema](https://ipld.io/specs/schemas/) of the identity format being used.
- The device and account fields are both compressed* secp256k1 public keys as a byte array.
- The sig field is a valid ECDSA signature created with:
  - signing key: private key of the account field as a public key.
  - signed data: device field as a byte array.

\* a compressed secp public key refers to point compression defined in section 2.3.3-2.3.4 of [Standards for Efficient
Cryptography 1 (SEC 1)](https://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf)
