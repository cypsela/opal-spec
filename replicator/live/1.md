## Introduction

The Live Replicator Protocol uses the Libp2p Pubsub and IPFS networks. Libp2p Pubsub is used to communicate the latest updates with peers and IPFS is used to fetch head blocks.


This document defines Libp2p Pubsub Topics used and the Live Replicator Message, as well as the Live Replicator Protocol.

## Design

There are two pubsub channels used:

  - Shared Channel: a pubsub channel for peers to set up private pubsub channels for the purpose of exchanging Live Replicator Messages.
  - Direct Channel: a pubsub channel for advertising heads on update via Live Replicator Messages.

The Shared Channel is watched for peers joining and leaving, this information should be available from the pubsub network implementation. No messages should be sent in this channel. The Peer-Ids will be used to create Direct Channels.

A Direct Channel is a pubsub channel unique per two participating peers' PeerIds. Direct Channels are not unique per database. If two peers are participating in two of the same databases, then Live Replicator Messages for both databases will be sent over the same Direct Channel.

## Shared Channel Topic

The Libp2p pubsub channel topic used is unique per database.
The topic is a combination of the prefix `/opal/replicator/live/1/` and the database manifest's CID.

format: `/opal/replicator/live/1/<multibase base32 encoded CID>`

example: `/opal/replicator/live/1/bafyreihd4xtkppbyyghpq55oyxu74qku4is7reffc6u5vszshl3ok5xjza`

#### [[database manifest spec]](./../../manifest/1.md)

## Direct Channel Topic

This pubsub channel topic used is unique per the two participating peer's ids. The topic is a combination of the prefix `/dps/1.0.0/` and the two [Peer-Ids](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/peer-ids/peer-ids.md#peer-ids) separated with a `/`.

The PeerIds must be encoded as CIDs according to their spec and then multibase base32 encoded.

The PeerIds must be ordered deterministically. The order is alphanumeric (e.g. 123...abc). Peer Id 1 must precede Peer Id 2 in alphanumeric order.
(wondering if abc...123 sort is better, dont know the name for it)

format: `/dps/1.0.0/<Peer Id 1>/<Peer Id 2>`

example: `/dps/1.0.0/bafzbeidlocfni4zjrmnn2sxui76ula3zymt37gkkavnnnv7y2tzlf2sace/bafzbeie5745rpv2m6tjyuugywy4d5ewrqgqqhfnf445he3omzpjbx5xqxe`

## Live Replicator Message

The only message type sent in the Direct Channel by the Live Replicator Protocol.

Since a Direct Channel may be used to replicate multiple databases with a peer, the message must contain the database it is meant for.

For a similar reason the message contains the protocol sending the message.

The message is sent as encoded CBOR.

## Protocol

### Requirements

Must be able to peer with Libp2p Pubsub peers to replicate with.

Must make replica entries available to peers from the local IPFS node.

### Shared Channel

> This Shared Channel is used to find peers that want to set up a Direct Channel for replication.

1. Join a pubsub channel with the topic matching the Shared Channel Topic for the database to be replicated.

2. On finding a pubsub peer, attempt to open a Direct Channel by joining a pubsub channel with the topic matching the Direct Channel Topic using the Peer Id of that joined peer and the local IPFS node's Peer Id.

3. Later, leave the pubsub channel when no longer looking to replicate with peers.

### Direct Channel

> The Direct Channel is used for directly sending head advertisement messages between peers

1. Join a pubsub channel with the topic matching the Direct Channel Topic for the peer to be replicated with.

2. Wait for the Direct Channel to be open. A Direct Channel is open if both peers are subscribed to the channel, otherwise it is closed.

3. While the Direct Channel is open:

    3.1 On update to the local replica's head entries:

    1. Send a Live Replicator Message for the database which includes the local replica's new head entry CIDs.

    3.2 On receiving a Live Replicator Message:

    1. Verify the message was sent by the remote peer, is the correct protocol version, and is for the expected database.

    2. Create a queue `Q`.
    
    3. Add every CID in message that is unknown to the replica to Q.

    4. Fetch all CID inside Q with IPFS.

    5. Remove resolved CID from Q.

    6. For every CID resolved to a valid entry created by an identity with access: add to replica and add every CID in the entry to Q.

    7. Repeat steps 4-6 until Q is empty.

4. Later, leave the pubsub channel when no longer looking to replicate any databases with that peer.
