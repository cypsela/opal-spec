## Introduction

The Keyvalue Store is used to derive a map of keys to values from a replica. The Store operations and the index are encoded in [dag-cbor](https://github.com/ipld/ipld/blob/master/specs/codecs/dag-cbor/spec.md).

## Operations

### `PUT`

The `PUT` operation will add or overwrite a key -> value pair in the map index. It has two properties: `key` which is a string, and `value` which can be any valid dag-cbor type.

The value for the operation's `value` field overwrites the value for the key in index matching the value of the operation's `key` field.

#### operation format:

```
{
  op: 'PUT',
  key: type 3
  value: any
}
```

### `DEL`

The `DEL` operation will set a key -> value pair's value to `null` in the map index. It has one property `key` which is a string matching the key of the k/v pair to null. 

#### operation format:

```
{
  op: 'DEL',
  key: type 3
}
```


## Index

The index is a map of keys to values where:

- Keys must be dag-cbor strings and values must be any valid dag-cbor type.
- Reading the value for a non-existant key must return `null`.
- Reading the value for an existing key must return that value.
